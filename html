        <p>Dear CEAP user,</p>
        <p>We observed some of your APIs on CAP-PROD have more than 1 minor version for each major version or more than 2 major versions, and those obsolete API versions consume more platform resource, result in additional maintenance effort and running costs, also may affect platform stability. Therefore, we kindly ask for your help in handling the obsolete API housekeep on PROD ASAP.</p>
        <div class="action-required">
            <h3>Action required:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Check the obsolete API versions for your team from <a href="#">attachment</a>.</li>
                <li>Run pipeline: <a href="#">User_Self_Housekeep_Prod_V1</a> to housekeep your obsolete APIs on PROD via self-service, you can refer: <a href="#">self-service Guide</a>. <span class="highlight">Please follow the rule: keep up to 2 major versions and 1 minor version for each major version.</span></li>
                <li>Post check and make sure your API works well after housekeeping.</li>
